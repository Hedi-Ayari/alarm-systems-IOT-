the idea of the project is to make a secure office from foreigners by giving an identity card to the employees who have allowed to enter the office
Credentials are stored in firebase cloud
the administrator has a phone application (flutter framework) that shows him who has entered the office
there is a humidity, flame and temperature sensor which can send an email to the administrator when there is a flame or high temperature in the office with IFTTT technology
